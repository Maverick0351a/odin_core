- **Priority System**: Higher priority rules can override lower priority decisions
- **Context-Aware**: Rules evaluate against comprehensive message and metadata context

#### **YAML Configuration System**
```yaml
# Example rule configuration
rules:
  - name: "high_confidence_approval"
    description: "Auto-approve high-confidence messages"
    priority: 10
    enabled: true
    action: "approve"
    conditions:
      - field: "confidence"
        operator: ">="
        value: 0.95
        description: "Very high confidence"
```

- **Validation**: `is_empty`, `is_not_empty`
- **Collection**: `in` (list membership), `not_in`

### 🎮 **Workflow Actions**
- **`APPROVE`**: Accept the message/request immediately
- **`REJECT`**: Deny the message/request with explanation
- **`RETRY`**: Attempt processing again (with possible healing)
- **`ESCALATE`**: Forward to human review or higher authority
- **`CONTINUE`**: Proceed with normal processing flow
- **`LOG_WARNING`**: Log an issue but continue processing
- **`CUSTOM`**: Execute custom handler logic for complex decisions

### 📊 **Analytics and Monitoring**
- **Execution Statistics**: Track rule triggering rates and performance

- **Compliance Checking**: Built-in PII and policy violation detection
- **Rate Limiting**: Message frequency and pattern anomaly detection
- **Input Validation**: Size limits and content validation

### 🚀 **API Endpoints Added**
- **`GET /rules/stats`**: Rule engine statistics and performance metrics
- **`GET /rules/list`**: List all configured rules with their status
- **`POST /rules/evaluate`**: Evaluate rules against provided context

```python
def semantic_drift_handler(context, rule):
    drift_score = context.get("semantic_drift", 0.0)
    if drift_score > 0.8:
        return {"action": "escalate", "reason": "High semantic drift"}
    elif drift_score > 0.5:
        return {"action": "retry", "reason": "Moderate semantic drift"}
    return {"action": "continue", "reason": "Acceptable drift"}
```

#### **Compliance Check Handler**
```python
def compliance_check_handler(context, rule):
    compliance = context.get("compliance", {})
    violations = []
    
    if compliance.get("contains_pii"):
        violations.append("PII_DETECTED")
    if compliance.get("inappropriate_content"):
        violations.append("INAPPROPRIATE_CONTENT")
    
    if violations:
        return {"action": "reject", "violations": violations}
